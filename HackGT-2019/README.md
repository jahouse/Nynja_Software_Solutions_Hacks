# Learning Mandarin with Google Assistant (LMWGA) - HackGT2019

## About the Project
### Practice makes perfect and that's no less true when learning Mandarin. Being a tonal language, Mandarin emphasizes the accuracy of pronounciation as multiple words may be spelled the same but their different tones will render a completely different meaning. In that, it is especially important for learners of Mandarin to have practice pronouncing words and rehearsing phrases regularly in order to cultivate a lasting vocabulary and understanding of the language. However, instructors or speaking partners may not be readily available for all learners. Here, we address this problem by creating an Action for the Google Assistant which will provide small lessons on the basics of Mandarin, available to any device with the Google Assistant.

### Currently, our Action includes a crash course on the four tones, emphasizing the importance of correct tones and allowing the user to practice listenig and reciting multiple words with a particular tone.
